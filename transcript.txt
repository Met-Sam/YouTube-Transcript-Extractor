initially.  What is the value
of  that? Yeah, I'm data  is
very  important.  You could
say that is probably
more valuable than  gold. But
then  maybe you have
actually  maybe you have
more  you maybe you have  the
gold  in  X in a  different
way in a way  again that  I
don't know  if the  public

Google  certainly has a
massive amount of data  so
does  Microsoft?  So  it's
not like
B is one of the best  sources
of  data. Can I ask you
